A few months back, I started looking at getting into flying something other than something like the docile Skysurfer. But what to get? I came across the Sonicmodell AR Wing Pro at one of the online hobby shops servicing my area during an anniversary sale, and it looked quite promising. I'd always been interested in flying wings as they are quite a different sort of plane, and this was designed to easily break down into three more easily transportable parts, and was specifically designed for FPV.
