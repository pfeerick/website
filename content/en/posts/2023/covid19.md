So, it seems like 2022 was just not my year... and 2023 can't make it's mind up yet. Putting aside the global histeria of COVID-19... [it's China's fault](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/letters-to-the-editor/china-is-clearly-to-blame-for-the-global-pandemic/2021/09/03/c5204c42-0c0a-11ec-a7c8-61bb7b3bf628_story.html) but [is it really](https://theintercept.com/2021/09/09/covid-origins-gain-of-function-research/)? The outbreak [started in Wuhan, China](https://www.who.int/news/item/27-04-2020-who-timeline---covid-19)... [but what about Italy](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1209646.shtml)? Was it a [biological weapon used against China and Iran](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8300139/) or just a new strain of the humble [coronavirus that was first discovered in 1965](https://www.webmd.com/covid/coronavirus-history)? Who knows? I certainly don't, and it really doesn't seem to me like we will ever know the truth. Plus, we've yet to see the long term implications and consequences of the [rapid testing and use of mRNA](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15265161.2020.1763696) and other vaccines.

What I do know is that it is real, and so is its not-so-common companion... [Long  COVID](https://www.abc.net.au/news/health/2022-11-25/long-covid-subtypes-treatment-disease-condition-heart-symptoms/101652610). I have to admit, when I first heard about it, I really didn't beleive it, and thought it was a load of nonsense. However, after having experienced it myself, and also watching my mother aflicted with it to a greater extent, it is something that I would not wish on anyone. For me, it has been a combination of brain fog, and chronic fatigue resulting in simply not having the energy to do things. And what I find particually vicious about this illness is that it is cyclic... you start feeling better, you start doing more things, you keep doing more as you gradually pace yourself back to recovery, and then it's like the rug just gets pulled from under you, and you're back to the brain fog and lack of energy, or worse. This [article probably describes it best](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-12-19/long-covid-symptoms-treatment-recovery/101751410), and while at first it seems like it was somehow releated to chronic fagitue, it seems like it is actually related to your bodies own autonomic system fighting itself. What is worse with this illness though, it seems to be something our GPs just don't know how to handle, and the [promised Long COVID clincs](https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/long-covid-clinics-likely-to-be-required-across-th) never appear to have eventuated. So while we have a public health system, it seems like it currently has its hands tied as there is nothing that GPs can really do, and there is no-one they can refeer patients onto to get more specialised assessment and care. 

It's starting to look like some shaking of the poltical tree will be needed to actually get some medical treatment...
