A [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio) driven static website, with random musings on electronics, model aircraft, radio control and anything else that I happen to be working on. 

This site started life as a Grav based site, but I finally decided to start working on it, so now it is Hugo based, so that I can easily work on it offline and push changes when I'm ready.
